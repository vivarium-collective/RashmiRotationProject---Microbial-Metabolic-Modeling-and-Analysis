        "# Community Modeling with PyCoMo\n",
        "PyCoMo is a python package that allows for the modeling and simulation of microbial communities, focusing on their interactions, metabolism, and dynamics. PyCoMo provides a set of tools to simulate and analyze how different species in a community interact with each other, share resources, and contribute to the overall ecosystem's function. Here, we will use the representative organisms identified from the t-SNE clustering to build the community model."
